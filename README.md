# PJATK's landing page
A first year student project centered around tempting the visitor to sign up to pjatk that is up and running [under this link](http://szuflandia.pjwstk.edu.pl/~s30305/landing_page/PJATK.php)
## overview
``` PJATK.php & main.css ``` -> A by the books landing page that supports both desktop and mobile. It consists of a call to action placed in the bottom right corner of promotional material, an about section that describes PJATK and mentions some of it's achievements, an reviews section, an socials&contact section and a message us section. All text content are taken from the variables initialized in lang.php. <br><br>
``` admin.php & admin.css ``` -> A minimalistic both in code and visuals website made to display the messages sent in PJATK.php to the ones who have the password. Can be viewed [here](http://szuflandia.pjwstk.edu.pl/~s30305/landing_page/admin.php) and the password is '1234', 'admin' or 'password'. <br><br>
``` lang.php ``` -> The first two lines of the code changes the lang session variable for when someone pressed one of the two hrefs in language-switch from PJATK.php. The following two if statements initialize variables for the website's text content and image alt text. <br><br>
``` slideshow.js ``` -> The logic behind changing the image every 45 seconds or upon pressing a button in the slideshow part of PJATK.php
